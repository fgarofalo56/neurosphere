 * Reference to the resource an action changes or an audit record concerns. `canonical_id` uses the catalog grammar `cloud:customer:source:type:id` (Clarification 7); the pattern here mirrors it and the catalog/v1 grammar is authoritative. Python validator `validate_target_ref_matches_catalog_grammar` in tests/contracts/test_canonical_ids.py checks this pattern against the catalog ID corpus so the two cannot drift. The version being acted on is carried beside this object (ActionIntent.target_version), not inside it, so it is hashed as its own field.
